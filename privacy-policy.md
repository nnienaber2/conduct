## What information we collect and why from website browsers 
If [You're](terminology.md#user) just browsing the [Website](terminology.md#website) or mobile app, [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) collect the same basic [information](terminology.md#information) that most websites and apps collect. [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) use common internet technologies, such as cookies and web server logs. This is stuff [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) collect from everybody, whether they have an [Account](terminology.md#account) or not.

The [information](terminology.md#information) [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) collect about all visitors to [Our](terminology.md#era-of-health) [Website](terminology.md#website) and the mobile app includes the visitor’s browser type, language preference, referring site, additional requested, and the date and time of each visitor request. [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) also collect potentially personally-identifying [information](terminology.md#information) like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.

## Why do we collect this?
[We](terminology.md#era-of-health) collect this [information](terminology.md#information) to better understand how [Our](terminology.md#era-of-health) [Website](terminology.md#website) visitors use [Era of Health](terminology.md#era-of-health) and to monitor and protect the security of the [Website](terminology.md#website) and mobile app. 

##  Information from users with accounts
If [You](terminology.md#user) create an [Account](terminology.md#account), [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) require some basic [information](terminology.md#information) at the time of [Account](terminology.md#account) creation. [You](terminology.md#user) will create [Your](terminology.md#user) own password, and [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) will ask [You](terminology.md#user) for a valid email address and phone number. [You](terminology.md#user) also have the option to give [Us](terminology.md#era-of-health) more [information](terminology.md#information) if [You](terminology.md#user) want to, and this may include "[Protected Health Information](terminology.md#protected-health-information-phi)."

"[Protected Health Information](terminology.md#protected-health-information-phi)" is defined by Code of Federal Regulations 45 CFR 164.402 and is [information](terminology.md#information) that [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) receive from a [User](terminology.md#user) or an [Organization](terminology.md#organization). It is [information](terminology.md#information) on a [Users](terminology.md#user) past, present, or future physical or mental health condition, provision, or payment, and could be used to identify the user. 

A "[User](terminology.md#user) "(or “You,” and “Your”) is an individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using [Era of Healths](terminology.md#era-of-health) services; that accesses or uses any part of the [account](terminology.md#account), or that directs the use of the [account](terminology.md#account) in the performance of its functions. A [User](terminology.md#user) must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for government [Accounts](terminology.md#account).

An "[Organization](terminology.md#organization)" is any individual or group that created an [Organization](terminology.md#organization) [account](terminology.md#account) in [Era of Health](terminology.md#era-of-health).

[User](terminology.md#user) "[Personal Information](terminology.md#personal-information)" is any [information](terminology.md#information) about one of [Our](terminology.md#era-of-health) [Users](terminology.md#user) which could, alone or together with other information, personally identify him or her. Information such as an email and password, a real name, and a photograph are examples of “[Personal Information](terminology.md#personal-information).”

[User](terminology.md#user) [Personal Information](terminology.md#personal-information) does not include aggregated, non-personally identifying information. [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) may use aggregated, non-personally identifying [information](terminology.md#information) to operate, improve, and optimize [Our](terminology.md#era-of-health) w[Website](terminology.md#website) and service.

[We](terminology.md#era-of-health) may use and/or disclose [Protected Health Information](terminology.md#protected-health-information-phi) in the same manner as [Personal Information](terminology.md#personal-information), as described above.  Additional uses or disclosures of Personal Health Information shall require the [Patient’s](terminology.md#patient) authorization or a valid authorization on the [Patient’s](terminology.md#patient) behalf.

For the remainder of this agreement [“Information”](terminology.md#information)” will be defined as both [User](terminology.md#user) “[Personal Information](terminology.md#personal-information)” and “[Protected Health Information](terminology.md#protected-health-information-phi).”

[We](terminology.md#era-of-health) use it to fill out [Your](terminology.md#user) profile and share that profile with other [Users](terminology.md#user) if [You](terminology.md#user) ask [Us](terminology.md#era-of-health) to.

[We](terminology.md#era-of-health) will use [Your](terminology.md#user) email address and phone number to communicate with [You](terminology.md#user) if [You've](terminology.md#user) said that's okay, and only for the reasons [You've](terminology.md#user) said that’s okay.

[We](terminology.md#era-of-health) use cookies (and similar technologies, like HTML5 localStorage) to keep [You](terminology.md#user) logged in, remember [Your](terminology.md#user) preferences, and provide [information](terminology.md#information) for future development of [Era of Health](terminology.md#era-of-health).

A cookie is a small piece of text that [Our](terminology.md#era-of-health) web server stores on [Your](terminology.md#user) computer or mobile device, which [Your](terminology.md#user) browser sends to [Us](terminology.md#era-of-health) when [You](terminology.md#user) return to [Our](terminology.md#era-of-health) site. Cookies do not necessarily identify [You](terminology.md#user) if [You](terminology.md#user) are merely visiting [Era of Health](terminology.md#era-of-health); however, a cookie may store a unique identifier for each logged in user. The cookies [Era of Health](terminology.md#era-of-health) sets are essential for the operation of the [Website](terminology.md#website)or are used for performance or functionality. By using [Our](terminology.md#era-of-health) website, [You](terminology.md#user) agree that [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) can place these types of cookies on [Your](terminology.md#user) computer or device.

## Google Analytics
[We](terminology.md#era-of-health) use Google Analytics as a third-party tracking service, but [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) don’t use it to track [You](terminology.md#user) individually or collect [Your](terminology.md#user) Information. [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) use Google Analytics to collect  [information](terminology.md#information) about how [Our](terminology.md#era-of-health) [Websites](terminology.md#website) performs and how [Our](terminology.md#era-of-health) [Users](terminology.md#user), in general, navigate through and use [Era of Health](terminology.md#era-of-health). This helps [Us](terminology.md#era-of-health) evaluate [Our](terminology.md#era-of-health) [Users](terminology.md#user) use of [Era of Health](terminology.md#era-of-health); compile statistical reports on activity; and improve [Our](terminology.md#era-of-health) content and [Website](terminology.md#website) performance.

Google Analytics gathers certain simple, non-personally identifying [information](terminology.md#information) over time, such as [Your](terminology.md#user) IP address, browser type, internet service provider, referring and exit pages, time stamp, and similar data about [Your](terminology.md#user) use of [Era of Health](terminology.md#era-of-health). [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) do not link this information to any of [Your](terminology.md#user) personal [Information](terminology.md#information) such as [Your](terminology.md#user) phone number.

[Era of Health](terminology.md#era-of-health) will not, nor will [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) allow any third party to, use the Google Analytics tool to track [Our](terminology.md#era-of-health) [Users](terminology.md#user) individually; collect any of [Your](terminology.md#user) information other than IP address, or correlate [Your](terminology.md#user) IP address with [Your](terminology.md#user) identity. Google provides further information about its own privacy practices and offers a browser add-on to opt out of Google Analytics tracking.

Certain pages on [Our](terminology.md#era-of-health) site may set other third-party cookies. For example, [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) may embed content, such as videos, from another site that sets a cookie. While [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) try to minimize these third party cookies, [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) can’t always control what cookies this third-party content sets.

## Tracking
"Do Not Track" is a privacy preference [You](terminology.md#user) can set in [Your](terminology.md#user) browser if [You](terminology.md#user) do not want online services to collect and share certain kinds of information about [Your](terminology.md#user) online activity from third-party tracking services. [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) do not track [Your](terminology.md#user) online browsing activity on other online services over time and [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) do not permit third-party services to track [Your](terminology.md#user) activity on [Our](terminology.md#era-of-health) site beyond [Our](terminology.md#era-of-health) basic Google Analytics tracking, which [You](terminology.md#user) may opt out of here. Because [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) do not share this kind of data with third-party services or permit this kind of third-party data collection on [Era of Health](terminology.md#era-of-health) for any of [Our](terminology.md#era-of-health) [Users](terminology.md#user), and [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) do not track [Our](terminology.md#era-of-health) [Users](terminology.md#user) on third-party websites ourselves, [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) do not need to respond differently to an individual browser's Do Not Track setting.

If [You](terminology.md#user) are interested in turning on [Your](terminology.md#user) browser’s privacy and Do Not Track settings, the Do Not Track website has browser-specific instructions.

When permitted, [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) will make a reasonable effort to notify [Users](terminology.md#user) of any disclosure of their information, unless [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) are prohibited by law or court order from doing so, or in rare, exigent circumstances.

## How You can access and control the Information we collect
If [You're](terminology.md#user) already an [Era of Health](terminology.md#era-of-health) user, [You](terminology.md#user) may access, update, alter, or delete [Your](terminology.md#user) [user](terminology.md#user) [Information](terminology.md#information) by editing [Your](terminology.md#user) [user](terminology.md#user) profile or contacting [Era of Health](terminology.md#era-of-health) Support at support@eraofhealth.com.

## Data retention, deactivation and deletion
[We](terminology.md#era-of-health) may retain certain [Information](terminology.md#information) indefinitely unless [You](terminology.md#user) request its deletion. For example, [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) don’t automatically delete inactive [user](terminology.md#user) [Accounts](terminology.md#account), we deactivate them. So unless [You](terminology.md#user) choose to request that [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) delete [Your](terminology.md#user) [Account](terminology.md#account), [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) will retain [Your](terminology.md#user) [Account](terminology.md#account) [information](terminology.md#information) indefinitely as deactivated.

If [You](terminology.md#user) would like to deactivate [Your](terminology.md#user) [Account](terminology.md#account) or delete [Your](terminology.md#user) Information, [You](terminology.md#user) may do so in [Your](terminology.md#user) [user](terminology.md#user) profile. [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) will retain and use [Your](terminology.md#user) [Information](terminology.md#information) as necessary to comply with [Our](terminology.md#era-of-health) legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce [Our](terminology.md#era-of-health) agreements. 

## How we communicate with you
[We](terminology.md#era-of-health) will use [Your](terminology.md#user) email address, phone or text messaging to communicate with [You](terminology.md#user) if [You've](terminology.md#user) said that's okay, and only for the reasons [You've](terminology.md#user) said that’s okay. [You](terminology.md#user) may manage [Your](terminology.md#user) communication preferences in [Your](terminology.md#user) [user](terminology.md#user) profile.

Depending on [Your](terminology.md#user) email, phone and text messaging settings, [Era of Health](terminology.md#era-of-health) may occasionally send notification emails, automated voicemails or text messages. [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) also send marketing emails, but only with [Your](terminology.md#user) consent. There's an unsubscribe link located at the bottom of each of the emails [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) send you.

[Our](terminology.md#era-of-health) emails might contain a pixel tag, which is a small, clear image that can tell [Us](terminology.md#era-of-health) whether or not [You](terminology.md#user) have opened an email and what [Your](terminology.md#user) IP address is. [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) use this pixel tag to make [Our](terminology.md#era-of-health) email more effective for [You](terminology.md#user) and to make sure[We're](terminology.md#era-of-health) not sending [You](terminology.md#user) unwanted email. If [You](terminology.md#user) prefer not to receive pixel tags, please opt out of marketing emails.

## Changes to this Privacy Policy

[We've](terminology.md#era-of-health) opened this [Privacy Policy](https://github.com/eraofhealth/conduct/blob/master/privacy-policy.md) up for [You](terminology.md#user) to amend and contribute to. [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) want [You](terminology.md#user) to see its historic revision and contribute to it future revision via a repository. [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) take [Our](terminology.md#era-of-health) relationship with [You](terminology.md#user) very serious and want to display nurture trust through transparency. By seeing the past revision [You](terminology.md#user) can see [Our](terminology.md#era-of-health) progression of thought over time. By allowing [You](terminology.md#user) to post suggestions [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) are enlisting [Your](terminology.md#user) help to make improvements to this [Privacy Policy](https://github.com/eraofhealth/conduct/blob/master/privacy-policy.md) in conjunction with [Our](terminology.md#era-of-health) ever-changing world. 

This [Privacy Policy](https://github.com/eraofhealth/conduct/blob/master/privacy-policy.md) is open to the public domain under [CC0-1.0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). This means [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) give [You](terminology.md#user) permission to copy and re-use this [Privacy Policy](https://github.com/eraofhealth/conduct/blob/master/privacy-policy.md) with [Our](terminology.md#era-of-health) permission. No questions asked.  Note that CC0-1.0 does not grant any trademark permissions.

Like other repositories, the two main ways to contribute are through Issues and Pull Requests. Feel free to use either option, whichever [You](terminology.md#user) prefer. [We've](terminology.md#era-of-health) made an issue template to request information that will help [Us](terminology.md#era-of-health) better understand [Your](terminology.md#user) feedback.

Before [You](terminology.md#user) decide to open an issue, browse [open issues] to see current requests. [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) also generally want to hear about: 

* International issues with [Our](terminology.md#era-of-health) policies
* Typos
* Clearer wording
* Other sites that have adapted and reused some of [Our](terminology.md#era-of-health) policies

Open an issue to tell [Us](terminology.md#era-of-health) about any of the above. [You](terminology.md#user) may also open a pull request to propose specific changes, but it's always OK to start with an issue.

**NOTE:** 
Issues are best used as a task list, where each issue contains one and only one thing to be addressed, resolved, fixed or decided. So please include only one work item per issue. This helps [Us](terminology.md#era-of-health) know when issues are completed and can be closed. In turn, this helps everyone watching the issues know when the item they're interested in has been resolved.

If [You](terminology.md#user) decide to open a pull request to the master branch, please be aware that it is unlikely that [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) will merge it directly. It's not because [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) don't like [Your](terminology.md#user) ideas, but because [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) will be opening new draft branches with each round of changes.

At this moment [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) have an annual review and modification process of the repository and the feedback [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) received. If changes are not needed, great! [We'll](terminology.md#era-of-health) let [You](terminology.md#user) know that [we're](terminology.md#era-of-health) not putting out an update, and we'll close any issues or PRs that are still hanging around. This allows plenty of time for discussion. Of course, [Era of Health](terminology.md#era-of-health) may alter this [Privacy Policy](https://github.com/eraofhealth/conduct/blob/master/privacy-policy.md) outside that schedule if necessary, such as when [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) have new product releases.

[You](terminology.md#user) can expect that someone from [Era of Health](terminology.md#era-of-health) legal department will see [Your](terminology.md#user) feedback, but [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) might not respond immediately. If [You](terminology.md#user) need an immediate answer on a legal matter, contact support@eraofhealth.com

If changes to a policy are needed, [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) will freeze feedback for two weeks. [We'll](terminology.md#era-of-health) draft changes based on the pull requests and input [we've](terminology.md#era-of-health) gotten. Then we'll post the updated policy as a pull request, and we'll get [Your](terminology.md#user) feedback on the pull request. The updated policy will be available here for thirty days before it goes into effect.

**NOTE:** 
Please don't post legal complaints or ask for technical support in this repository. [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) may not respond to issues or comments promptly. If [You](terminology.md#user) need help, contact support@eraofhealth.com and they'll get [You](terminology.md#user) an answer.

Please avoid hypotheticals. [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) can't give [You](terminology.md#user) legal advice, which means [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) often can't tell [You](terminology.md#user) if a hypothetical situation would or wouldn't be a violation of [Our](terminology.md#era-of-health) policies. [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) also can't tell [You](terminology.md#user) what [You](terminology.md#user) should or shouldn't do. [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) can tell [You](terminology.md#user) how [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) interpret [Our](terminology.md#era-of-health) policies.

Please don't give other [Users](terminology.md#user) legal advice in this repository, to avoid confusion.
